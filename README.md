## Pairing Rounds

Given a group of people, split them into pairs. Then each round, calculate a new
set of pairs where each person will meet every other person only once.

This is built as a progressive web app with creat-react-app. The code lives in
the `frontend/` folder. It's published on GitHub pages at:
